Improper disposal of solid wastes could lead to disruptive effects that impact daily human lives. Waste management serves a great importance especially to the health of human lives. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
To contribute to the effort in solid waste segregation, we created a machine learning model that could classify the trash images into two categories, namely: biodegradable and non-biodegradable. Trash images is inputted to the pre-trained Mask R-CNN where the output segmented images are categorized in a classification machine learning model. For the trash classification machine learning model, Xception model achieved the highest validation accuracy of <b>92.61%</b>. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">  
The resulting classification is fed back to the pre-trained Mask R-CNN for it to output the bounding box of the object and its classification. This model was implemented on both input image and video which will serve a great help to industrial waste management facilities.
